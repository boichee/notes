#Ionic Lab

##Concept

Expand on the Ionic application we started in class [today](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/notes/blob/master/lectures%2Fweek-11%2F_1_monday%2Fdusk%2Fionic.md).

##User Generated Posts

Create a route to a new `post.html` template, which allows the user to create a new post. Display an input field for the new post's `title`. On submission of the form, add the new post to `$scope.posts` and redirect to the `feed.html` page.

##Bonus

Add the attribute `time` to each post and have it store the time it was created and displayed on the `feed.html`.

Use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/quickstart.html) to make your data persistent & real-time!
