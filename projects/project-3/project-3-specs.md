# Project 3
For the final project of the cohort you will combine your knowledge of front and back-end to produce a full-stack application that can be visited by anyone on the internet. This is the last thing you will build at WDI, so think carefully about what it will be and give it your best effort!

##Project Objectives

* Build confidence in your independence as a web developer.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.


## Timeline

* **Project Kickoff** starts on Wednesday, February 11th, at 4:00pm
* **Final Deliverables** due on Thursday, February 19th at 10:00am

## Final Deliverables

* Heroku hosted application 
* Link to source code on GitHub
* Meet the **Core Requirements**

## Core Requirements
Your project should incorporate...

* **Good planning** Outline an MVP, write user stories, create wireframes, and define your schema. Be able to articulate and defend the choice of technologies that makes up your application.
* **Self learning** We encourage you to work on this project individually, if you want to work in a group you must first request approval from an instructor.
* **Something new** Learn and implement something (library, technology, API, etc) that you've never used before.
* **UX Consideration** Think about the entire experience of your application before you start coding. Try to schedule time with a UXDI student who can help in planning the execution of your concept.
* **Models** Your app should have three models that are associated in some way.
* **Testing** Write model, controller, and routing tests for the back-end of the application. Optionally, add acceptance tests to have good test coverage.
* **DRYness** Use partials, modular functions, etc to make the code readable and well organized.
* **Comments** Write comments for parts of the code that are not straightforward.
* **Good naming** Name variables semantically.
* **A back-end** Build the back-end in Rails, but if you really want to use another option such as Express, Firebase, etc get approval from an instructor.  
* **Persistent Data** As necessary, validate data before saving it to your database. If you're planning to not use a SQL database, please ask for permission from an instructor.
* **Authentication and Authorization** Either build a login system proprietary to your app or implement oAuth with a third party.
* **Styling** Use a library such as Bootstrap, Foundation, etc to implement a grid system and some basic assets to your pages. It is recommended that you make the application responsively designed.
* **Front-end JavaScript** Create interactivity and event driven functionality. Implement framework(s) and/or library(s) that will spice up the application.
* **AJAX / Angular** Create single-page behavior by either leveraging AJAX or Angular to asynchronously communicate with the server.
* **An external API** Use at least one external API to enrich the user's experience.
* **Heroku** Deploy your application to Heroku, so that it can be shared and disseminated.
* **Documentation** Write a README file that describes the app, its purpose, what technologies were used, and how to set it up.
